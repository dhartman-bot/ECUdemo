# Tractor ECU Monolith Demo

A realistic embedded ECU (Electronic Control Unit) controller demonstration for agricultural equipment. This project simulates a monolithic control system that can be analyzed and decomposed into microservices.

## üéØ Purpose

This demo showcases:
1. **Monolithic architecture** with tightly coupled subsystems
2. **Complex interdependencies** between modules
3. **Real-world embedded patterns** common in agricultural equipment
4. **Migration path** from monolith to microservices

Perfect for demonstrating code analysis, dependency mapping, and refactoring capabilities with Claude Code.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The ECU controller manages 5 key subsystems:

### 1. **Engine Control**
- RPM management and throttle control
- Fuel injection and consumption tracking
- Temperature and pressure monitoring
- **Dependencies**: CANBus, Diagnostics

### 2. **Hydraulics Control**
- Hydraulic pressure regulation
- PTO (Power Take-Off) control
- Implement operations (raise/lower)
- **Dependencies**: Engine (for pump speed), CANBus, Diagnostics

### 3. **Transmission Control**
- Gear selection (Park, Neutral, Drive 1-4, Reverse)
- Clutch engagement
- Speed calculations
- **Dependencies**: Engine (for gear ratios), CANBus, Diagnostics

### 4. **Diagnostics**
- Fault code tracking (up to 50 faults)
- System health monitoring
- Event logging
- **Dependencies**: CANBus

### 5. **CAN Bus**
- Inter-module communication
- Message buffering
- Bus load monitoring
- **Dependencies**: None (core layer)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed dependency graphs and design analysis.

## üìä Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Inspect the Monolith

**Goal**: Understand what the codebase does and how modules interact.

**Claude Code prompts:**
```
1. "Analyze this codebase and explain what it does"
2. "Map out all the dependencies between modules"
3. "What are the main features of this system?"
4. "Show me all the places where Engine module is used by other modules"
5. "What would happen if the Engine module fails?"
```

### Scenario 2: Analyze for Microservices

**Goal**: Identify boundaries for service extraction.

**Claude Code prompts:**
```
1. "Which module has the fewest dependencies?"
2. "What would it take to extract the Engine module into its own service?"
3. "Map all the CAN bus message IDs and their purposes"
4. "What data contracts exist between modules?"
5. "Create a migration plan to break this into microservices"
```

### Scenario 3: Extract Engine Service

**Goal**: Isolate the Engine module into a standalone service.

**Claude Code prompts:**
```
1. "Extract the Engine module into a standalone service"
2. "Create a REST API for the Engine service"
3. "Replace direct Engine calls with HTTP requests"
4. "Add MQTT support for Engine telemetry"
5. "Create docker-compose for Engine + message broker"
```

**Expected artifacts:**
- `services/engine-service/` - Standalone engine controller
- `services/engine-service/api.py` - REST API endpoints
- `services/engine-service/Dockerfile` - Container definition
- `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service orchestration
- Updated main controller using HTTP client

### Scenario 4: Add New Feature

**Goal**: Demonstrate difficulty of adding features to monolith vs microservices.

**Claude Code prompts:**
```
1. "Add a new GPS/Navigation module to the monolith"
2. "How many files need to be modified?"
3. "What are the risks of this change?"
4. "Now show me how this would be easier with microservices"
```

## üîç Key Files for Demo

- `src/main.c` - Main control loop, shows system initialization
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system documentation

### Explore dependencies:
- `src/engine/engine_control.c` - Lines 24-40 show CANBus usage
- `src/hydraulics/hydraulics.c` - Line 20 shows Engine dependency
- `src/transmission/transmission.c` - Line 21 shows Engine dependency

### Understand the problems:

- Single point of failure

   - ECUs control complex machinery (tractors, combines, sprayers)
   - Real-time requirements (engine timing, hydraulic response)
   - Safety-critical systems (must be reliable)
   - Long service life (10-20 years)

2. **Why monoliths exist in embedded**
   - Resource constraints (limited CPU, memory)
   - Real-time determinism (predictable latency)
   - Toolchain maturity (C/C++ ecosystem)
   - Legacy codebases (decades old)

3. **Modern trends**
   - More powerful embedded processors
   - Connectivity requirements (IoT, telematics)
   - Over-the-air updates
   - Cloud integration

4. **Migration challenges**
   - Cannot stop a running tractor for updates
   - Network reliability (fields have poor connectivity)
