# Tractor ECU Monolith Demo

A realistic embedded ECU (Electronic Control Unit) controller demonstration for agricultural equipment. This project simulates a monolithic control system that can be analyzed and decomposed into microservices.

## üéØ Purpose

This demo showcases:
1. **Monolithic architecture** with tightly coupled subsystems
2. **Complex interdependencies** between modules
3. **Real-world embedded patterns** common in agricultural equipment

## üìä Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Inspect the Monolith

**Goal**: Understand what the codebase does and how modules interact.

**Claude Code prompts:**
```
1. "Analyze this codebase and explain what it does"
2. "Map out all the dependencies between modules"
3. "What are the main features of this system?"
4. "Show me all the places where Engine module is used by other modules"
5. "What would happen if the Engine module fails?"
```

### Scenario 2: Analyze for Microservices

**Goal**: Identify boundaries for service extraction.

**Claude Code prompts:**
```
1. "Which module has the fewest dependencies?"
2. "What would it take to extract the Engine module into its own service?"
3. "Map all the CAN bus message IDs and their purposes"
4. "What data contracts exist between modules?"
5. "Create a migration plan to break this into microservices"
```

### Scenario 3: Extract Engine Service

**Goal**: Isolate the Engine module into a standalone service.

**Claude Code prompts:**
```
1. "Extract the Engine module into a standalone service"
2. "Create a REST API for the Engine service"
3. "Replace direct Engine calls with HTTP requests"
4. "Add MQTT support for Engine telemetry"
5. "Create docker-compose for Engine + message broker"
```

**Expected artifacts:**
- `services/engine-service/` - Standalone engine controller
- `services/engine-service/api.py` - REST API endpoints
- `services/engine-service/Dockerfile` - Container definition
- `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service orchestration
- Updated main controller using HTTP client

### Scenario 4: Add New Feature

**Goal**: Demonstrate difficulty of adding features to monolith vs microservices.

**Claude Code prompts:**
```
1. "Add a new GPS/Navigation module to the monolith"
2. "How many files need to be modified?"
3. "What are the risks of this change?"
4. "Now show me how this would be easier with microservices"
```

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system documentation

### Explore dependencies:
- `src/engine/engine_control.c` - Lines 24-40 show CANBus usage
- `src/hydraulics/hydraulics.c` - Line 20 shows Engine dependency

- No versioning or backward compatibility
- Single point of failure
- Complex interdependencies (Implement depends on Hydraulics, PTO, and Engine)
